    <div>A poem or a letter, I dont know but some of the lines, I like
    <pre><i><b>
        When u r feeling really blue,
        The world has turned against U,
        And u dont know what to do,
        And u r feeling more confused
        Than u ever could express,
        when u would rather be inside ur bed,
        pillows all over ur head,
        And u have to ask WHY ME?
        And when the happiness all around,
        The flying colors and confidence u found,
        Please, ask yourself Why ME? then, too.
